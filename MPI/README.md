## Assignment 

You are to implement a simple traffic simulator.

Consider a linear road divided into consecutive
segments numbered 0..N as in the figure below
- N is represented by variable num_segments in the template
- You may assume the number of segments to be a multiple of the number of processes

The simulation evolves in descrete rounds for a given number of iterations (num_iterations in the template file).

At each round:
- Some cars enter the road in segment 0
	- Use function create_random_input() to obtain the number of cars
- Each car either remains in the same segment or moves to the next one
	- Use function move_next_segment() to determine if a car moves or not
	- Cars that move out of the last segment are not part of the simulation anymore

Every 10 iterations, you have to compute the total number of cars that are currently within the road:
- Process P0 prints the sum
- The code for printing is already in the template
	- Run the simulation in parallel on multiple processes, minimizing synchronization and communication as much as possible
	- You may set DEBUG to 1 to obtain deterministic values and check the correctness of your code
- At each round a single car enters the road â€“ Cars always move to the next segment
